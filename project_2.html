		  Project Two: (x)topia duet

	  <p>
		  Artist's reflection:
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  	For these two works I started with a simple idea of expressing and exploring loops. Specifically, 
		  I wanted to explore the growing infringement of AI processes on everyday human experience. I felt that 
		  I should push this to the edge of absurdity and then take at least one more step. But why loops? And what 
		  exactly is a loop in the context of this exploration? 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  I have been fascinated with loops for most of my life. I discovered programming at a very young age 
		  and was amazed by the power of the algorithmic loop; like a simple “for” loop or even just a “goto” 
		  loop in BASIC. This ability to iterate over a set of data, or a process, and make tiny changes each 
		  time. The realization that the starting state and the ending state could be so vastly different even 
		  though the changes that got us there were nearly imperceptible when examining a single iteration of 
		  the loop. One loop, in fact, is hardly a loop at all. If we say x=5 and then ask what 3 times x 
		  equals we get 15. One loop. If we then increment x by double it’s previous value such that it’s now 
		  10 and then we run this loop again we get 30. Now we run it again and we get 60 and if we run it 100 
		  times, x = 5 times 6 to the 100th power. That’s an astronomically massive number. And we got there in 
		  100 steps of a very simple loop. Loops are power. But are they good or bad power?
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  When I set out to create my two (x)topias (and I’ll explain (x)topia a little further down) I wanted 
		  one to clearly depict the negative reality, the existential experience of living in a society dominated 
		  by a loop in which humans only experience the outcome, which is consumption of shiny things. Why 
		  consumption of shiny things? Because at a very basic level humans are wired to get a kick of dopamine 
		  when they experience something new that is also perceived as positive. Why? A million years of evolution 
		  during which we were seldom exposed to new and shiny, but new and shiny often meant better chances of 
		  survival. So what if AI can create a loop in which the result is the human receives new, shiny stuff? 
		  What would that reality look like to the human, from inside their cognitive reality? And what would 
		  that reality look like from the outside; from an external observer?
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  	One image would be the internal reality, where shiny is everywhere, the utopia. The other image 
		  would be the external reality of decay and conspicuous consumption, the dystopia. They would show a 
		  clear delineation of existence. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  	I started with the utopia. I wanted it to be clean, bright, roomy, shiny. I wanted a single color 
		  to pop and dominate the scene. I wanted that color to be associated with clean, clear, fresh. I chose 
		  blue. Blue is water, blue is clear sky, blue is a “new” color. I also wanted a simple sense of comfort. 
		  I find shaggy things comfortable and so there’s blue shag on the lounge chairs. I wanted a sense of fancy. 
		  A blue yak. Totally preposterous, but also ultimate shag and very chill. The space needed a high-tech display. 
		  Star Trek TNG introduced the world to LCARS (it’s a type of user interface that makes very little sense, 
		  but looks super cool) so this space would have an LCARS display. The protagonist reclines in her lounge 
		  chair atop a shag blue throw, comfortable, confident, excited about what shiny new thing will come next. 
		  This scene is the inner space of the new shiny loop.

	  <p>
		  	Happy with the utopia I started work on the dystopia. It needed to be everything the utopia wasn’t, 
		  orange instead of blue, dingy instead of clean, underground instead of in the light. It should be a space 
		  that is under constant surveillance, so it needed an ever-watchful camera tucked away somewhere obvious, 
		  but seemingly hidden. The protagonist, the same person from the first image, reclines, but in a chair 
		  that exudes old, musty, dark living room vibes. They’re older, sad, lost. The technology they use to 
		  ‘jack in’ is clunky and cumbersome. This scene is the existential reality of the loop.

	  <p>
		  	As I finished the dystopia I realized that in fact, it wasn’t really all that terrible of a place. 
		  Yes, it was a bit dank and dark, but it also had a sense of comfort about it, a sense of being lived-in 
		  and even loved. I went back to the utopia image and just started adding a bits here and there to make it 
		  feel more industrial, more contrived. What I discovered after a few hours of going back and forth was that 
		  I was no longer sure which was which. The utopia had somehow devolved into a shiny proto-dystopia and 
		  the dystopia had evolved into a well-worn, musty proto-utopia.

	  <p>
		  They had both crossed a threshold and contained shared DNA that bridged the gulf between utopia 
		  and dystopia. I found this delightful as my understanding of both topias is that either can step 
		  in, can represent the other, depending upon perspective. One human’s dystopia is another human’s 
		  utopia. Look at the political situation in the US right now. There are some who believe this is 
		  the greatest era of American prosperity and change ever - they are, of course, delusional and 
		  dangerous, but they exist. And there are those, among whom I count myself, who believe we’re 
		  sliding into … dystopia.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		   Are these images effective at telling the story of the original concept? No, not truly. In fact, 
		  I believe the sense of “loop-ness” has been significantly dialed back, particularly in (x)topia 
		  two, such that it’s difficult to see that these two images are reflections of one another. There 
		  are signs of this: both protagonists are reclining, they are on opposite sides of the image, they 
		  appear to be “jacked” into something, they exist in a space that feels surreal, dreamlike. But 
		  there is nothing overt, no one thing that strictly binds them together. Perhaps I could have 
		  added some piece of identically rendered tech and that would make the connection. Or I could 
		  have added some kind of “tether” that links the two humans in an obvious manner. But perhaps 
		  it’s best that it’s not obvious. This wasn’t my initial intent. I wanted it to be obvious. But 
		  it does create a, I believe, a strong sense of wonder and, perhaps, a desire to let the eye 
		  wander about to see find all the bits that don’t quite fit; all the bits that point to this 
		  reality not being our own.
