    </h3>
    <p>
        In this first project for ART222 I was asked to create a logo for the university's Southworth Planetarium.
        The tool of choice for this project was Adobe Illustrator. Learn more <a href="http://art222.geekpower.com/project_1.html">here</a>.

    </h3>
    <p>
        In (x)topia my intention was to explore the concept of loops as we perceive them in space and time through the 
        flat, rectangular confines of a collage assembled from found images. Was I successful? Not entirely. But you can

        This found footage video project explores the theme of Yesterday's Tomorrow within the context of 1950s 
        found footage of "kitchens of tomorrow" and the "future of space." It also explores what happens when
        these images are recontextualized through the inclusion of music, in this case, a remix of two songs
        which are both (loosely) thematically related to space. Exprience this

    </h3>
    <p>
        This exploration of 3D design involves a 63 year old light meter  
        <a href="https://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Gossen_Lunasix">(Gossen Luna Pro)</a>
        and over 22 hours of mucking about in Blender. Though the mucking was very enjoyable. You can 
        see the outcome <a href="http://art222.geekpower.com/project_4.html">here</a>
