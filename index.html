		  Project Two: (x)topia duet
	  </h3>
	  <p>
		  Artist's reflection:
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  	For these two works I started with a simple idea of expressing and exploring loops. Specifically, 
		  I wanted to explore the growing infringement of AI processes on everyday human experience. I felt that 
		  I should push this to the edge of absurdity and then take at least one more step. But why loops? And what 
		  exactly is a loop in the context of this exploration? 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  I have been fascinated with loops for most of my life. I discovered programming at a very young age 
		  and was amazed by the power of the algorithmic loop; like a simple “for” loop or even just a “goto” 
		  loop in BASIC. This ability to iterate over a set of data, or a process, and make tiny changes each 
		  time. The realization that the starting state and the ending state could be so vastly different even 
		  though the changes that got us there were nearly imperceptible when examining a single iteration of 
		  the loop. One loop, in fact, is hardly a loop at all. If we say x=5 and then ask what 3 times x 
		  equals we get 15. One loop. If we then increment x by double it’s previous value such that it’s now 
		  10 and then we run this loop again we get 30. Now we run it again and we get 60 and if we run it 100 
		  times, x = 5 times 6 to the 100th power. That’s an astronomically massive number. And we got there in 
		  100 steps of a very simple loop. Loops are power. But are they good or bad power?
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  When I set out to create my two (x)topias (and I’ll explain (x)topia a little further down) I wanted 
		  one to clearly depict the negative reality, the existential experience of living in a society dominated 
		  by a loop in which humans only experience the outcome, which is consumption of shiny things. Why 
		  consumption of shiny things? Because at a very basic level humans are wired to get a kick of dopamine 
		  when they experience something new that is also perceived as positive. Why? A million years of evolution 
		  during which we were seldom exposed to new and shiny, but new and shiny often meant better chances of 
		  survival. So what if AI can create a loop in which the result is the human receives new, shiny stuff? 
		  What would that reality look like to the human, from inside their cognitive reality? And what would 
		  that reality look like from the outside; from an external observer?
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  	One image would be the internal reality, where shiny is everywhere, the utopia. The other image 
		  would be the external reality of decay and conspicuous consumption, the dystopia. They would show a 
		  clear delineation of existence. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  	I started with the utopia. I wanted it to be clean, bright, roomy, shiny. I wanted a single color 
		  to pop and dominate the scene. I wanted that color to be associated with clean, clear, fresh. I chose 
		  blue. Blue is water, blue is clear sky, blue is a “new” color. I also wanted a simple sense of comfort. 
		  I find shaggy things comfortable and so there’s blue shag on the lounge chairs. I wanted a sense of fancy. 
		  A blue yak. Totally preposterous, but also ultimate shag and very chill. The space needed a high-tech display. 
		  Star Trek TNG introduced the world to LCARS (it’s a type of user interface that makes very little sense, 
		  but looks super cool) so this space would have an LCARS display. The protagonist reclines in her lounge 
		  chair atop a shag blue throw, comfortable, confident, excited about what shiny new thing will come next. 
		  This scene is the inner space of the new shiny loop.

	  <p>
		  	Happy with the utopia I started work on the dystopia. It needed to be everything the utopia wasn’t, 
		  orange instead of blue, dingy instead of clean, underground instead of in the light. It should be a space 
		  that is under constant surveillance, so it needed an ever-watchful camera tucked away somewhere obvious, 
		  but seemingly hidden. The protagonist, the same person from the first image, reclines, but in a chair 
		  that exudes old, musty, dark living room vibes. They’re older, sad, lost. The technology they use to 
		  ‘jack in’ is clunky and cumbersome. This scene is the existential reality of the loop.

	  <p>
		  	As I finished the dystopia I realized that in fact, it wasn’t really all that terrible of a place. 
		  Yes, it was a bit dank and dark, but it also had a sense of comfort about it, a sense of being lived-in 
		  and even loved. I went back to the utopia image and just started adding a bits here and there to make it 
		  feel more industrial, more contrived. What I discovered after a few hours of going back and forth was that 
		  I was no longer sure which was which. The utopia had somehow devolved into a shiny proto-dystopia and 
		  the dystopia had evolved into a well-worn, musty proto-utopia. 
	  </p>
	  <img src="(x)topia_one.png" width="80%" alt="(x)topia one">
	  <div class="image_text">(x)topia one [finished]</div>
	  <p>
		  They had both crossed a threshold and contained shared DNA that bridged the gulf between utopia 
		  and dystopia. I found this delightful as my understanding of both topias is that either can step 
		  in, can represent the other, depending upon perspective. One human’s dystopia is another human’s 
		  utopia. Look at the political situation in the US right now. There are some who believe this is 
		  the greatest era of American prosperity and change ever - they are, of course, delusional and 
		  dangerous, but they exist. And there are those, among whom I count myself, who believe we’re 
		  sliding into … dystopia.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		   Are these images effective at telling the story of the original concept? No, not truly. In fact, 
		  I believe the sense of “loop-ness” has been significantly dialed back, particularly in (x)topia 
		  two, such that it’s difficult to see that these two images are reflections of one another. There 
		  are signs of this: both protagonists are reclining, they are on opposite sides of the image, they 
		  appear to be “jacked” into something, they exist in a space that feels surreal, dreamlike. But 
		  there is nothing overt, no one thing that strictly binds them together. Perhaps I could have 
		  added some piece of identically rendered tech and that would make the connection. Or I could 
		  have added some kind of “tether” that links the two humans in an obvious manner. But perhaps 
		  it’s best that it’s not obvious. This wasn’t my initial intent. I wanted it to be obvious. But 
		  it does create a, I believe, a strong sense of wonder and, perhaps, a desire to let the eye 
		  wander about to see find all the bits that don’t quite fit; all the bits that point to this 
		  reality not being our own.

    <h3>
      Project One: Southworth Planetarium Logo
    </h3>
    <p>
      Arist's reflection:
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagining a logo for the Southworth Planetarium took me through my creative inspiration and planning paces. 
      On a macro scale, inspiration tends to arrive when I have a lot of different thoughts (or half-thoughts) 
      banging around in my head at once. There is often a critical moment where a key piece of this unknown 
      puzzle finds me. Perhaps I’m reading an article from Art News, or Hackaday, or seeing a video on YouTube 
      about how the Voyager probes process instructions, or I notice the way light reflects and refracts off a 
      sliver of plastic in my studio. The spark that kindles the idea coalescence process could be almost anything. 
      But then, it really cannot be almost anything as it usually comes from some source that is part of a relatively 
      carefully curated collection of seemingly random input that I surround myself with. A list would be exhaustive 
      and exhausting, but it includes the above-mentioned article and youtube sources as well as things that I have 
      scattered around my studio; particularly toys and games. But the moment of coalescence is just that, a moment 
      of seeing something all at once. Sometimes that image is perfectly clear, but often it’s quite fuzzy and thus 
      invites me to explore it and ask a lot of “what if” questions.
    </p>
    <p>
	For the planetarium I surrounded my creative space with images, ideas and other mess that suggested 
      voyaging into the unknown, travelling through interstellar space, peering into the inky darkness 
      that seems to occupy most of space, and a feeling of the 1970s and 1980s. I chose those two decades as 
      they followed the planetarium boom of the 50s and 60s<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup> and added color and design elements I thought might be fun, 
      like the blue, orange, green triadic palette that made it to the final design. The key ingredient was the typeface 
      used by Stanley Kubrick in his 1968 film, 2001 A Space Odyssey. While he used Futura for much of the text in the 
      film, he turned to Gill Sans for the title screen text. Seeing that text immediately brought up an image of 
      the Discovery spaceship that the main characters, including Dave Bowman, use to travel to Jupiter to investigate 
      the “anomaly.” Seeing that ship immediately reminded me of the star projector at the planetarium. Images started 
      to cascade in my mind and the basic design for the logo was there. I was really drawn to the idea of the planetarium’s 
      projector as a spacecraft, just like Discovery; they both have similar lines and they both offer travel beyond 
      the rim of our pale blue dot. I quickly sketched out a version of the logo as I saw it (below) and then left it 
      alone to sit in Illustrator and in my mind.
    </p>
	  <img src="1_DanielStephens_PlanetariumLogo_1.png" width="80%" alt="Logo Version One">
	  <div class="image_text">Logo Version One</div>
<p>
	At this point I move into evaluate and execute mode. What do I love about the design, what do I find abrasive 
	or disjunctive, what do I find confusing. Looking at the logo again I really didn’t like the shape of the 
	“spaceship/projector,” it felt chunky and sits awkwardly in space. I also didn’t understand why I’d placed the 
	“planet” upside down. While I like the way it looks, it leaves me wondering what the orange circle is in the 
	upper right corner. I know that it’s supposed to be a distant planet, but why would a planet sit in the “atmosphere” 
	of another planet? It didn’t ring true. I did like the colors and how they sit together. I liked the orange limb on 
	each of the spaceship’s spheres. I liked the rising star. Knowing how I felt drove the second pass of the logo. 
	I wanted to flip the large planet 180 degrees and find a more energetic expression of the spaceship and bring 
	the rising star more into the foreground.
</p>
<p>
	After a few hours of play I arrived at a design that I felt captured my initial vision and felt balanced and 
	energetic (Logo Version 2). I then spent time tweaking things like the thickness of the spaceship’s orange 
	limbs, the placement of the pale blue line through the spaceship’s spheres and the placement and alignment 
	of the text. These tweaks brought the logo to a point where I felt comfortable sharing it. 
</p>

	  <div class="image_text">Logo Version Two</div>
<p>
<p>
	Most of the feedback I received was relatively positive and centered around the amount of thought I put into the 
	logo and the overall design. One piece of critical feedback I received was a desire to see the spaceship’s sphere’s 
	stretched out further apart in the “widescreen” version of the logo in order to make better use of the available 
	space. I absolutely agree, giving the spheres a little more space would fill out the frame more fully and give 
	the viewer’s eye more of a journey across the logo. It could also allow for an alignment of the the left edge 
	of the text with the left-most part of the pale blue line that connects the spaceship’s spheres, further pulling 
	the piece together (like a good area rug). 
</p>
<p>
	The major critique I would give myself is that this logo is simply too busy for a “modern” logo. There are too 
	many fine details, thus limiting its use on small screens or cramped spaces. A third pass at the logo would 
	involve simplifying it further and spending more time with it in the form of a small app icon.
</p>
<p>
	I tend to learn the same things again and again when I make something: my first idea isn’t always my best; 
	I need to spend time away from the alpha version of the work before I come back to it; and I need to trust 
	my eyes and heart more than my logical, reductionist mind. A quick example of this last realization is the 
	idea of the projector as “spaceship.” It’s an interesting idea, it makes logical sense, but rendering that 
	projector-spaceship such that it gives off a “spaceship” vibe and a planetarium “projector” vibe requires 
	too much detail in the line work. It’s better to let the “spaceship” idea live as a piece of the final 
	render without making it something a viewer sees immediately. It’s okay to simply suggest a thing and it’s 
	okay if the viewer doesn’t pick up on consciously. In fact, it’s likely better that way.

<h6><span id="footnote_1">1</span> I found a reference to the peak excitement around planetariums on the planetarium wikipedia page; 
		  certainly not academic-paper level research, but I needed a quick answer and it was okay if it 
		  was slightly inaccurate.
